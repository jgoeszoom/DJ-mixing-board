# UCR-CS120B
Repository containing the various versions and pertinent files for my final project for the UCR CS120B course.

CS120B at UCR is the introduction to embedded systems class. Topics covered in the class include 
embedded processor programming, custom processor design, standard peripherals such as buttons, joysticsk,
etc. 

This final project is a simplified version of a DJ Mixing board, typically these boards are used to manipulate the properties of 
songs and music in general. They allow the changing of frequency, adding or layering on new music over one another, typically through
buttons and analog inputs such as encoders and or potentiometers. 

In my own version of the DJ Mixing board I have opted to use fewer inputs, these inputs will consist of a potentiometer and four buttons. 
My outputs will be a 16x2 LCD, a sound buzzer, and an LED Matrix or LED Bar. 
The LCD will be used to help the user navigate the menu that I will implement to help showcase the possible options that they have
to manipulate the music that they either make themselves or the built-in music that I will include. 
The sound buzzer will be to play the music that was created and or manipulated. 
The LEDs will be to provide the user some visuals to accompany the music. 

# Known Bugs
Currently the create sub-menu portion of the code does not work. 
As of now it is impossible to create your own music to manipulate.
